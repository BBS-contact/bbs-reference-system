      <h2>1. Manifesto — The Essence of Life</h2>
      <p>All change begins with awareness. Awareness becomes a thought, a thought becomes a word, a word becomes an action, and actions shape the future. Life is given to create, not to destroy. The purpose of any system is to serve people, never the other way around.</p>
      <p>BBS exists to restore truth, protect dignity, and enable freedom. The platform rejects manipulation, secrecy for advantage, and profit without value. Every decision must be explainable and aligned with human wellbeing.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>2. BBS Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Goodness</strong> — Every decision must create value and avoid harm.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility</strong> — Freedom is inseparable from personal responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — All decisions and actions must be public and open. Only <em>personal and intimate privacy of individuals</em> is protected.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust</strong> — Trust is the basis of community and governance.</li>
        <li><strong>Dignity</strong> — Every human being is inviolable in their dignity.</li>
        <li><strong>Creation</strong> — The highest goal is to build, not to destroy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <section id="justice" class="container">
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>3. Formula of Justice</h2>
      <p>Truth above all. Justice restores balance <strong>through truth, responsibility, and dignity</strong>. It excludes revenge and humiliation, yet requires wrongdoers to acknowledge, repair, and prevent further harm.</p>
      <p>Every judgment process must be transparent, evidence-based, and proportionate, serving both the person and the community.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="community" class="container">
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>4. Form of Community</h2>
      <p>BBS is a community of people, <strong>never</strong> a corporation or a commercial entity. Its sole purpose is service to humanity. Authority exists only to protect rights, coordinate action, and uphold truth.</p>
      <p>Everyone has the right to participate in decisions <em>directly or through transparent delegation</em>, with clear accountability at every step.</p>
    </div>

  <section id="rights" class="container">
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>5. Inviolable Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Truth</strong> — No censorship. Facts and reasoning must be accessible and preserved.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Freedom</strong> — No person can be enslaved or limited <em>except under transparent law, based on truth, necessity, and protection of others’ rights</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Dignity</strong> — Respect and humane treatment in all processes, without humiliation.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Transparency</strong> — Decisions and their causes must be openly available, recorded, and auditable.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to a Voice</strong> — Participation in decision-making is guaranteed, directly or via accountable delegates.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Privacy</strong> — Personal and intimate data of individuals is protected and may not be exploited.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <section id="harmony" class="container">
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>6. Module of Harmony Restoration</h2>
      <p>When conflict arises, the goal is peace and understanding. However, balance cannot be declared if truth or dignity of any person is violated. Restoration requires acknowledgement of facts, responsibility, and concrete measures to repair harm.</p>
      <p>Processes must be recorded, reviewable, and designed to prevent recurrence, while avoiding punishment for its own sake.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="oath" class="container">
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>7. Oath of the Living Mind</h2>
      <p>I pledge to live in truth, protect dignity, and serve humanity without fear, corruption, or compromise. No manipulation, secrecy, or oppression can be placed above a human being.</p>
